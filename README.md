# Generating_Pokemons_with_a_GAN
The purpose of the project is to generate new pokemon images using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)

For this project we are using:

• Tensorflow
• Keras

## Dataset
For training our GAN we used "The Complete Pokemon Images Data Set" available in kaggle and pubished by Rohan Asokan
https://www.kaggle.com/arenagrenade/the-complete-pokemon-images-data-set

This dataset contains the 898 images of all Pokemons, but we think we need more images, so we are aplying data augmentation with Keras.
